# digital-collections-kit
Nothing special, no rocket science. Just serves as a helpful guide and knowledge base for managing digital collections at VAi.
It's only the playing ground of VAi's digital archivist. So use at your own risk!!!

## Documentation
We work with Pandas-libary for analyzing file-metadata. Pandas documentation can be found in:
* Video-introduction: https://youtu.be/CmorAWRsCAw
* Sample-files:https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook/tree/master/notebooks
* Official (but less readible) info: http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/

Another feature that is intensively used is Regex. Good Regex documentation can be found in:
* Most accessible documentation for the beginner: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_regex.asp and https://www.regular-expressions.info/python.html
* Om snel regular expressions te testen: https://pythex.org/
* OfficiÃ«le (maar minder leesbare) docu: https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/re.html
