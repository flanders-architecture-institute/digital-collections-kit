# digital-collections-kit
This is the manual repository for operations on the (mainly) digital collections of VAi. The repository supports internal archival processes of VAi, but everybody is welcome to take a look and use the stuff on your own behalf. Yet be aware that you'll use it on your own risk! Many manuals are specifically for VAi or are only in experimental or unfinished mode.

Please take a look at our Wiki: https://github.com/flanders-architecture-institute/digital-collections-kit/wiki

## Documentation
We work with Pandas-libary for analyzing file-metadata. Pandas documentation can be found in:
* Video-introduction: https://youtu.be/CmorAWRsCAw
* Sample-files:https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook/tree/master/notebooks
* Official (but less readible) info: http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/

Another feature that is intensively used is Regex. Good Regex documentation can be found in:
* Most accessible documentation for the beginner: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_regex.asp and https://www.regular-expressions.info/python.html
* Om snel regular expressions te testen: https://pythex.org/
* OfficiÃ«le (maar minder leesbare) docu: https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/re.html
